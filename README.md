# Crypto_Volatility
Interactive mathematical dashboard exploring cryptocurrency price stability through adjustable wave patterns, amplitude, frequency, and drift parameters. Simulates market behavior using AI-driven mathematics with real-time volatility analysis and trend visualization.


# Project Description
This is an interactive financial analytics dashboard created during the Mathematics formative assessment that is based on AI. The app enables users to find out the behaviour of cryptocurrencies by modelling mathematical and interactive data visualization. It helps users to simulate real-time conditions in the market by changing parameter of amplitude, frequencies, and drift and even pattern type.

# Project Purpose

The goal of this dashboard is to:

1.Demonstrate how mathematical functions influence market behaviour.

2.Help users understand volatility and price trends visually.

3.Build a real-world AI-style analytics tool using Python and Streamlit.

4.Transform storyboard planning into a functional deployed application.


# Features

1.Interactive sidebar controls

2.Wave-based and random volatility simulation

3.Adjustable amplitude, frequency, and drift parameters

4.Real-time dynamic chart updates

5.Volatility index calculation
